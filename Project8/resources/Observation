My observation---

When I look at the graph RUN-1, I notice that the runtime decreases when recursion limit increases from 2.
And after it goes down to a point, the trend becomes flat(almost, not exactly). For the idea of how recursion limit affects the runtime.
the graph should look like a check(goes down first then goes up). But in the real life, CPU would do a lot of work at the same time,
and that would affect the runtime as well. So the reason the fluctuations occur can be watching videos, playing games and etc while
running the program. So the most accurate way to measure the trends is to minimize the work that CPU is working on. Or just stay the same,
try not to open up a new app or even close one.
